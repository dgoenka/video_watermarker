- now for the backend. In the project folder itself (i.e fronted), make a new folder called "backend" (which I will later move to ../frontend afterwards, hence don't link or reuse code from the project)  and inside that initialise a totally new, separate, independent, production-ready Node, Typescript, Fastify backend. Initialise the env file.
- the backend will have 4 endpoints: 
 	- upload - where the frontend will upload the video, the whole component structure with show/hide toggle timestamps, size, position and all other styling info (in case of pictures, even the pictures) - (code needs to be updated on submit button click for the same). the response will be a job id. assume that the system also has postgres install (use the creds from env) and store the jobid, status and the output filepath below together.
	-  status - for a given job id, the backend will spawn a task - assume that the shell has FFMPEG installed. using all the component tree info in the request, we need to rasterize the same it into the video. exactly as it looked in the wysiwyg editor. since the upload would be completed, this job would continue afterwards independently in the backend. the frontend will ping the backend periodically with this job id for the status (a dialog or a progress wheel can be shown starting from the upload and during this along with some useful info). save the output to a folder configured in the env file (initialise for now with "/Users/divyanshgoenka/Movies/outputs" ). the output file name and path are determined in advance and saved with the job id. lets keep the saving configured such that post processing we can move the file to a cdn, and save the required info instead of the path then to download the file. the frontend keeps pinging this api to get the completion status.
	- download - after the job is successfully completed, the frontend will call the download api. if the job was not successfully completed, an error is returned, else the file download is started (or if a CDN is configured, CDN link is generated and sent - frontend takes appropriate action)
	- retry - if the job had ended in an error, this end point allows the frontend user to retrigger the job.
